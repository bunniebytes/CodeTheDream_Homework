What happened to Tammie ThoXXmas was that the majority were mispelled.  Instead of thefuzz replacing with the correct spelling, it took the one that showed up most even though to a person it would be incorrect.\n","\n","2. The approach also failed for Charles because there were 8 different Charles Smith in the databases.  The address \"908 Kelsey Tunnel Suite 775 Cassandrabury, ID\" was written 4 different ways, so none of them ended up as majority, which resulted in the address being completely overwritten.  Then the one Charles Smith with the \"new\" address had a NaN zip, so majority and filling in from other instances of Charles Smith would not work.\n","\n","3. In these instances, I would manually go in an look at the data that had a discrepency and compare it to the other information I have.  I would then update it manually as this would be a very specific case of what went wrong.\n","\n","4. I would not use the majority spelling, but rather I learned about \"Levenshtein Distance\" which gives a score of probability if they are the same string.  I would not replace a string without the score being above a certain threshold.  The most common one according to what I read seems to be a score of 80.  I had also started before realizing that the homework gave specific algorith for name and address, creating a new column of a string of Name and Address to compare.  I feel like this would help alleviate some of the discrepencies of names being replaced."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"49a3be8a","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005087,"end_time":"2026-01-09T22:27:34.962296","exception":false,"start_time":"2026-01-09T22:27:34.957209","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["##
